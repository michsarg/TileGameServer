TO DO:

4 - Player Issues
    Next, we should make the experience for players that join partway through an existing game, by helping them to catch up on the game state.


BUGS TO SORT OUT:
    OVERALL:
         - Im having to use try/except to deal with disconnects. There needs to be a faster way to handle disconnects i.e. move queue

    AUTOPLAYS:
        - initial token placement NOT appearing on board, but is there in the logic
        - tiles that are autoselected are not from the players hand
