TO DO:

*** live_idnums needs to be a list that only contains active players ***
    - need to implement another thread to handle messages in game between server and players
    - incoming data needs to be accepted from every client
        - if its a chunk
            -process if turn correct
            - ignore if turn incorrect
        - if not a chunk
            - remove player


3- Connection Issues
    server must be able to handle unexpected network behaviour
    *   if a player exits durng game they should be eliminated then next player turn starts or if one left then they win
    *   server shoudl handle players attempting to join during the game by giving them updates but not letting them play turns


BUGS TO SORT OUT:

    - turn order lost when player quits mid game
    - playesr need to be stopped from sending out of turn messages
