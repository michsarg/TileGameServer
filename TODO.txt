TO DO:

TIER REVIEW:
    1 - GOOD
    2 - GOOD
    3 - EXITING:
        - exit during own turn  
            - game not restarting properly when new join during game
            - non playing players not in connected_idnums
            - hopefully this can be fixed with code improvments below
        - exit during others turn
            - GOOD
      - JOIN DURING GAME:
            - GOOD
    4 - CATCH UP GAME STATE 
        - GOOD 
      - AUTOPLAY 
        - GOOD

CODE IMPROVEMENT - 
    CREATE SEND MESSAGE METHOD
        - parameters: recipient, msg
        - single receiptient, msg at a time
        - this will allow single method where try catch needs to be implemented (good design!)
    CREATE BOARD CLASS
    CREATE PLAYER CLASS

- review turn log process
    - i.e. at Line 419 in update_and_notify does the turn log only need to be updated once??? YES
        - this change has been made NEEDS TESTING

- elimination
    - i.e. at Line 431, do we still need a prev eliminated?
        - need to replay and watch eliminated list if its cleared each play
