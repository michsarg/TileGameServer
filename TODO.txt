TO DO:

3- Connection Issues
    server must be able to handle unexpected network behaviour
    *   if a player exits durng game they should be eliminated then next player turn starts or if one left then they win
    *   server shoudl handle players attempting to join during the game by giving them updates but not letting them play turns


BUGS TO SORT OUT:

    - turn order lost when player quits mid game
    - playesr need to be stopped from sending out of turn messages
