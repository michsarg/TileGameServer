TO DO:

TIER REVIEW AGAIN:
    1 - 2 PLAYER GAME
        - yes, the two player game works

    2 - AUTO RESTART
        - yes, the game will auto restart with randomly chosen players
      - 4 PLAYER 
        - Yes, works after elimination on self turn or other turn
    
    3 - EXITING:
        - exit during own turn  
            - if first player exits during first tile placement, next player gets win message BUT game progresses properly MAYBE OK!
            - if first player exits during token selection, OK!
            - if two players left, and non turn exits, other player wins on tile placement OK!
            - on or off turn for secondary tile placement OK!
            - mostly OK!
      - JOIN DURING GAME:
            - turn progresses properly, no problem with restart OK!
    4 - CATCH UP GAME STATE 
        - GOOD 
      - AUTOPLAY 
        - works with no manual players
        - mix of manual and auto... sometimes works sometimes doesnt! wtf!


CODE IMPROVEMENT - 
    CREATE SEND MESSAGE METHOD
        - parameters: recipient, msg
        - single receiptient, msg at a time
        - this will allow single method where try catch needs to be implemented (good design!)
    CREATE BOARD CLASS
    CREATE PLAYER CLASS

- review turn log process
    - i.e. at Line 419 in update_and_notify does the turn log only need to be updated once??? YES
        - this change has been made NEEDS TESTING

- elimination
    - i.e. at Line 431, do we still need a prev eliminated?
        - need to replay and watch eliminated list if its cleared each play

- removal thread
    - needs to be locked while removal is happening
